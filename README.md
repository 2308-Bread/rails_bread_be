## Getting Started

Ensure that you have [Ruby 3.1.4](https://github.com/ruby/ruby) && [Rails 7.0.8](https://github.com/rails/rails) installed.

Fork and/or Clone this Repo

Once on your local, `bundle install`.

In your terminal:
- Run `bundle exec rspec` to make sure all of your tests are passing.
- `rails db:{drop,create,seed,migrate}`

## Database Visualization
![Bread Schema Visualization]()

## Testing
- `bundle exec rspec` will run all of the tests at once 
- For the SimpleCov coverage report in the terminal run `open coverage/index.html`

- If you want to run only a specific file use the following syntax: `bundle exec rspec spec/facades/geolocation_facade_spec.rb`
  -  Add `:11` to the end of the previous line if you only want to run the test starting on line 11.
